# Discovery → Presentation Traceability (USA Pawn Holdings)

| Gap # | Severity | Discovery Issue | PoC Feature Built | Pitch Card Title | Live CTA |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| 01 | Critical | Early lock/closing-time inconsistency causes immediate walk-away loss | Persistent chat + store-status guidance + scheduling intake | "Customers ready to transact are being turned away" | `/?source=door` |
| 02 | Critical | No after-hours appraisal path for high-intent leads | Guided AI photo appraisal flow + appraisal logging | "No instant valuation when the store is unavailable" | `/appraise` |
| 03 | High | Legacy website creates conversion leaks and no strong lead-capture journey | Modern landing + chat capture + inventory browse | "Your web traffic has nowhere to convert" | `/inventory` |
| 04 | High | Weak communication reliability near close damages trust and conversion | Web chat + SMS/voice channel stack + conversation archive | "Missed conversations become missed loans" | `/` |
| 05 | Medium | Accountability blind spots from absentee-oversight pattern | QR clock-in + staff logs + compliance alerts dashboard | "Operational consistency is hard to verify in real time" | `/dashboard` |
| 06 | Revenue Upside | No customer-facing real-time online inventory flow | Searchable inventory grid + category filters + item dialogs | "Inventory visibility can create daily upsell lift" | `/inventory?category=Jewelry` |
| 07 | Revenue Upside | No dedicated after-hours lead capture funnel at door/print touchpoints | Door-source chat open + appraisal-first hero modes | "After-hours demand is not being captured" | `/?heroMode=appraisal&heroOpen=1` |
