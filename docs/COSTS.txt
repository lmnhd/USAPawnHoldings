**Costs-Monthly**
1. OpenAI (RTAPI): $10 - 20?
2. OpenAI responses: $5?
3. OpenAI vision: $10?
4. Render.com: $7
5. Twilio phone number: $1.15
6. Twilio SMS (~600 msgs): $10
7. SMS (A2P 10DLC campaign): $10 (basically not even worth the money unless you only expect a million important text messages! - might as well push guests to use web-chat!)
8. AWS (Lambda/DDB/APIGW): ~$0-2
9. Vercel: $20 (covers all other projects too)

total: ~$86??




A2P 10DLC Campaign fee ($10/month recurring) — You mentioned it in the notes below but didn't add it to the cost list. This is mandatory for production SMS in the US.

OpenAI text/Responses API — Your $10 covers the Realtime Voice API, but dispatcher.py (SMS handler) also calls OpenAI. At low volume it's probably $1-3/month, but it's a separate line item.

AWS costs — Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway. At PoC/small-shop volume you'll almost certainly stay in the free tier, but worth noting: ~$0-2/month.

Vercel — Frontend hosting. Free tier covers this easily at this scale: $0.

Revised monthly cost picture:

Item	Monthly
OpenAI Realtime API (voice)	$10
OpenAI Responses API (SMS/chat)	~$2
Render.com (voice server)	$7
Twilio phone number	$1.15
Twilio SMS (~600 msgs)	$10
A2P 10DLC campaign	$10
AWS (Lambda/DDB/APIGW)	~$0-2
Vercel	$20 (covers all other projects too)
Total	~??
One-time costs: ~$4 (A2P brand registration)

What to charge:

For a local solo operator, 3-4x cost coverage is the floor, then you price to value (AI handles calls/texts 24/7 so Brandon doesn't have to):

Tier	Price	Rationale
Minimum viable	$99/mo	~2.3x costs, covers your time/support
Sweet spot	$149/mo	~3.5x, leaves meaningful margin
Premium (with setup fee)	$199/mo + $299 setup	If you're onboarding, configuring, training
At $149/month your gross margin is ~$105/month per client. The value prop (never miss a repair lead, 24/7 auto-response) easily justifies $149 to a shop doing even $3K/month in repairs.
