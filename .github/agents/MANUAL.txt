What are custom agents?
The built-in agents provide general-purpose configurations for chat in VS Code. For a more tailored chat experience, you can create your own custom agents.

Custom agents consist of a set of instructions and tools that are applied when you switch to that agent. For example, a "Plan" agent could include instructions for generating an implementation plan and only use read-only tools. By creating a custom agent, you can quickly switch to that specific configuration without having to manually select relevant tools and instructions each time.

Custom agents are defined in a .agent.md Markdown file, and can be stored in your workspace for others to use, or in your user profile, where you can reuse them across different workspaces.

You can reuse your custom agents in background agents and cloud agents, enabling you to run autonomous tasks with the same specialized configurations.

Why use custom agents?
Different tasks require different capabilities. A planning agent might only need read-only tools for research and analysis to prevent accidental code changes, while an implementation agent would need full editing capabilities. Custom agents let you specify exactly which tools are available for each task, ensuring the AI has the right capabilities for the job.

Custom agents also let you provide specialized instructions that define how the AI should operate. For instance, a planning agent could instruct the AI to collect project context and generate a detailed implementation plan, while a code review agent might focus on identifying security vulnerabilities and suggesting improvements. These specialized instructions ensure consistent, task-appropriate responses every time you switch to that agent.

Note
Subagents can run with a custom agent. Learn more about running subagents with custom agents (experimental).

Handoffs
Handoffs enable you to create guided sequential workflows that transition between agents with suggested next steps. After a chat response completes, handoff buttons appear that let users move to the next agent with relevant context and a pre-filled prompt.

Handoffs are useful for orchestrating multi-step workflows, that give developer's control for reviewing and approving each step before moving to the next one. For example:

Planning → Implementation: Generate a plan in planning agent, then hand off to implementation agent to start coding.
Implementation → Review: Complete implementation, then switch to a code review agent to check for quality and security issues.
Write Failing Tests → Write Passing Tests: Generate failing tests that are easier to review than big implementations, then hand off to make those tests pass by implementing the required code changes.
To define handoffs in your agent file, add them to the frontmatter. Each handoff specifies the target agent, the button label, and an optional prompt to send:

Markdown

---
description: Generate an implementation plan
tools: ['search', 'fetch']
handoffs:
  - label: Start Implementation
    agent: implementation
    prompt: Now implement the plan outlined above.
    send: false
    model: GPT-5.2 (copilot)
---
When users see the handoff button and select it, they switch to the target agent with the prompt pre-filled. If send: true, the prompt automatically submits to start the next workflow step.

Custom agent file structure
Custom agent files are Markdown files and use the .agent.md extension and have the following structure.

Note
VS Code detects any .md files in the .github/agents folder of your workspace as custom agents.

Header (optional)
The header is formatted as YAML frontmatter with the following fields:

Expand table
Field	Description
description	A brief description of the custom agent, shown as placeholder text in the chat input field.
name	The name of the custom agent. If not specified, the file name is used.
argument-hint	Optional hint text shown in the chat input field to guide users on how to interact with the custom agent.
tools	A list of tool or tool set names that are available for this custom agent. Can include built-in tools, tool sets, MCP tools, or tools contributed by extensions. To include all tools of an MCP server, use the <server name>/* format.
Learn more about tools in chat.
agents	A list of agent names that are available as subagents in this agent. Use * to allow all agents, or an empty array [] to prevent any subagent use. If you specify agents, ensure the agent tool is included in the tools property.
model	The AI model to use when running the prompt. Specify a single model name (string) or a prioritized list of models (array). When you specify an array, the system tries each model in order until an available one is found. If not specified, the currently selected model in model picker is used.
user-invokable	Optional boolean flag to control whether the agent appears in the agents dropdown in chat (default is true). Set to false to create agents that are only accessible as subagents or programmatically.
disable-model-invocation	Optional boolean flag to prevent the agent from being invoked as a subagent by other agents (default is false).
infer	Deprecated. Use user-invokable and disable-model-invocation instead.
target	The target environment or context for the custom agent (vscode or github-copilot).
mcp-servers	Optional list of Model Context Protocol (MCP) server config json to use with custom agents in GitHub Copilot (target: github-copilot).
handoffs	Optional list of suggested next actions or prompts to transition between custom agents. Handoff buttons appear as interactive suggestions after a chat response completes.
handoffs.label	The display text shown on the handoff button.
handoffs.agent	The target agent identifier to switch to.
handoffs.prompt	The prompt text to send to the target agent.
handoffs.send	Optional boolean flag to auto-submit the prompt (default is false)
handoffs.model	Optional language model to use when the handoff executes. Use the qualified model name in the format Model Name (vendor), for example GPT-5 (copilot) or Claude Sonnet 4.5 (copilot).
Note
If a given tool is not available when using the custom agent, it is ignored.

Body
The custom agent file body contains the custom agent implementation, formatted as Markdown. This is where you provide specific prompts, guidelines, or any other relevant information that you want the AI to follow when in this custom agent.

You can reference other files by using Markdown links, for example to reuse instructions files.

To reference agent tools in the body text, use the #tool:<tool-name> syntax. For example, to reference the githubRepo tool, use #tool:githubRepo.

When you select the custom agent in the Chat view, the guidelines in the custom agent file body are prepended to the user chat prompt.

Create a custom agent
You can create a custom agent file in your workspace or user profile.

Select Configure Custom Agents from the agents dropdown and then select Create new custom agent or run the Chat: New Custom Agent command in the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).

Choose the location where the custom agent file should be created.

Workspace: create the custom agent definition file in the .github/agents folder of your workspace to only use it within that workspace

User profile: create the custom agent definition file in the current profile folder to use it across all your workspaces

Tip
You can configure additional locations where VS Code searches for custom agent files by using the 
chat.agentFilesLocations

 setting. This is useful for sharing agents across projects or keeping them in a central location outside your workspace.
Enter a file name for the custom agent. This is the default name that appears in the agents dropdown.

Provide the details for the custom agent in the newly created .agent.md file.

Fill in the YAML frontmatter at the top of the file to configure the custom agent's name, description, tools, and other settings.
Add instructions for the custom agent in the body of the file.
To update a custom agent definition file, select Configure Custom Agents from the agents dropdown, and then select a custom agent from the list to modify it.

Customize the agents dropdown list
If you have multiple custom agents, you can customize which ones appear in the agents dropdown. To show or hide specific custom agents:

Select Configure Custom Agents from the agents dropdown.

Hover over a custom agent in the list, and then select the eye icon to show or hide it from the agents dropdown.

Tool list priority
You can specify the list of available tools for both a custom agent and prompt file by using the tools metadata field. Prompt files can also reference a custom agent by using the agent metadata field.

The list of available tools in chat is determined by the following priority order:

Tools specified in the prompt file (if any)
Tools from the referenced custom agent in the prompt file (if any)
Default tools for the selected agent (if any)
Share custom agents across teams
To share custom agents across your team, you can create a workspace-level custom agent (.github/agents folder). If you want to share custom agents across multiple workspaces within your organization, you can define them at the GitHub organization level.

VS Code automatically detects custom agents defined at the organization level to which your account has access. These agents appear in the Agents dropdown in chat alongside the built-in agents, and your personal and workspace custom agents.

To enable discovery of organization-level custom agents, set 
github.copilot.chat.organizationCustomAgents.enabled

 to true.
Learn how you can create custom agents for your organization in the GitHub documentation.

Frequently asked questions
Are custom agents different from chat modes?
Custom agents were previously known as custom chat modes. The functionality remains the same, but the terminology has been updated to better reflect their purpose in customizing AI behavior for specific tasks.

If you have existing .chatmode.md files, rename them to .agent.md to convert them to the new custom agent format and place them in the appropriate location (
chat.agentFilesLocations

) to continue using them.
How do I remove a custom agent?
To completely remove a custom agent from VS Code:

Delete the corresponding .agent.md file from your workspace or user profile.
Select Configure Custom Agents from the agents dropdown, hover over the custom agent in the list, and select the trash icon.
To remove a custom agent that was contributed by an extension, you need to uninstall the extension that provides it. If you don't want to uninstall the extension, you can hide the custom agent from the agents dropdown instead. Follow the steps in Customize the agents dropdown list.

How do I know where a custom agent comes from?
Custom agents can come from different sources: built-in agents, user-defined agents in your profile, workspace-defined agents in your current workspace, organization-defined agents, or extension-contributed agents.

To identify the source of a custom agent:
