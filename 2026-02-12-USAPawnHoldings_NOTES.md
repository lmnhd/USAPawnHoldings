1. lOOKING at their website, it's so simple I believe we could just extract all of their data, scrape it, and put it in our demo to show the full product complete with AI for inventory checks and customer relations AND appraisals
2. Let's build a fully working system (no mockup functionality - mock input data ONLY) to demonstrate what her new Management system will look and behave - convincing her to switch web sites and all! We will handle her tech needs going foward!
3. We need to think BEYOND her side business and show that we can be useful with her MAIN business as well - without acutally mentioning it!



How about a system for entering new items into inventory using a phone, take image and give the AI any relevant info and it catalogues and indexes the item, complete with product description, SkU, other meta - and updates the 'Products' page dynamically!




### Things we can also add!
 - Allow customers to create tickets online (during appraisals) for faster processing when they come in.
 - A system to help speed up staff members when researching and processing merch. Auto updated in inventory online!

 - You probably already have multiple networks or systems in place for your everyday business, we can incorporate any or all of them into 1 unified system! Even your paid services like CRM's and Social Media Management.

 - System to 'Auto-Post' new items on social media

 - Amazon store automation

 - add auto tracking/delete from inventory upon sale.
